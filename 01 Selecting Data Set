After some thought and discussion, the data set that I am interested in is substacce abuse. The study from 
ICPSR, National Survey of Substance Abuse Treatment Services.(https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/ICPSR/studies/4256#), provides information 
on age groups and percentages that uses substances.

One question I am focusing on are what are the percentages of youth ranging from middle school(10-11) to high school(17-18) are abusing substances.
Another is what is the percentage of youth that abuse substances are using them to battle mental illness. I figured that they both go hand in hand with eachother.

I cannot add the source codebook just yet due to distrubution of information but the github link is provided below.
