The Focus frequency table was added because I needed the percentage of the study that dealt with "substance abuse treatment services" and "mix of mental health and suibstaance abuse". 
With this I can know this is the right study to work with.

The assessment mental health table was added because I needed the percantge of people that were assessed to have mental health. 
Since the focus of this project is the mix of mental health with substance abuse, this was mandatory.

The Therapy table was to see the perecentage of people that actually got therapy in the study.
